Test - Made with reactjs

build a simplified banking system

the system has 2 types of users

1. a customer

2. an admin

customer user stories:

-   a user can create a new account with username and password

-   a user starts with 0 balance

-   a user can deposit more money to his account by uploading a picture of a check and entering the amount of the check. if the check is approved by an admin, the money is added to the bank account.
-   /\*\*
-   -   The picture can be of anything, you don't need to parse it or validate it in any way
-   \*/

-   to buy something, the user enters the amount and description; a user can only buy something if she has enough money to cover the cost.

-   a user can see a list of balance changes including time and description.

admin user stories:

-   an admin account is already created with a hard coded username and password.

-   an admin can see a list of pending check deposit pictures with amount and picture and click to approve or deny the deposit.

Simplifying Assumptions

-   an admin canâ€™t be also a customer
